# thispersonnowexists
First NFT project from DesignDao

"This Person Now Exists" is an experimental NFT project that combines randomly generated portraits using thispersondoesnotexist.com and Avatar SDK.

ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com uses Nvidiaâ€™s publicly available artificial intelligence technology to draw an invented, photo-realistic human being with each refresh. Combined with Avatar SDK we are able to create 3D avatars from these portraits.

"This Person Now Exists" collection consists of 1000 randomly generated 3D avatars. This collection is the first collection from DesignDao and will be airdropped to twitter users for free.

The collectors of this collection are the genesis of the DesignDao, a dao funded by design in the metaverse. This collection can be displayed in Oncyber galleries and other metaverse platforms that support 3D file types.
